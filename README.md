Title: Ethnic Bias of Standardized Testing

Theme: Education & Arts

Abstract: In this project, I utilized data science to discover if there was a correlation between ethnicity and standardized test results. 
A correlation ranker revealed that certain ethnicities do marginally better than others. As the population of certain minorities increases, the average score increases and vice versa.

Relevance to NYC: The datasets used are New York Statewide Testing results limited to NYC schools.
